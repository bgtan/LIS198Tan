This keylogger is a very simple keylogger that not only tracks your keystrokes and the windows you type them in, but also simple mouse events such as left-clicks and right-clicks. Logs are also labeled by date.

Before clicking on the .pyw file, please open the source code in a text editor first to edit the directory of filelog.

Clicking the main .pyw file will not prompt a window, but it will automatically run the keylogger in the background. The only way to terminate the program is to force stop it through the task manager.

Points for Improvement:
1. Import a script that would allow the program to run upon the computer's startup.
2. Make the keylogger case sensitive. In its current state, the keylogger does not detect whether or not a keystroke is in uppercase or lowercase.
